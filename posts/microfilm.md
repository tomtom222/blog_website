# Information Density: Microfilm And Microfiche

Today, we think nothing of sticking thousands of pages of documents on a tiny SD card, or just pushing it out to some cloud service. But for decades, this wasn't possible. Yet companies still generated huge piles of paper. What could be done? The short answer is: microfilm.

However, the long answer is quite a bit more complicated. Microfilm is, technically, a common case of the more generic microform. A microform is a photographically reduced document on film. A bunch of pages on a reel of film is microfilm. If it is on a flat card — usually the size of an index card — that's microfiche. On top of that, there were a few other incidental formats.

## Types of Microforms

There were several different types of microforms used throughout history:

- Microfilm rolls
- Microfiche cards
- Aperture cards (computer punch cards with microfilm)
- Microcards (printed on cardboard instead of film)

## The Technology Behind It

In its heyday, people used specialized cameras, some made to read fanfold computer printer paper, to create microfilm. There were also computer output devices that could create microfilm directly.

## Reading and Storage

To read microfilm or microfiche, you needed a special viewer. These ranged from simple handheld devices to large machines with high-quality optics and the ability to print copies of what you were viewing.

The real advantage was storage density. A single roll of microfilm could hold thousands of pages, and a small filing cabinet could hold millions of pages worth of information. This was revolutionary for its time.

## Modern Relevance

While microfilm might seem obsolete in the digital age, it has some interesting properties that make it still relevant:

1. Long-term stability (100+ years with proper storage)
2. No special technology needed to read (just magnification)
3. Cannot be altered without detection
4. Not susceptible to bit rot or format obsolescence

These properties make microfilm still valuable for archival purposes, even in our digital world.
